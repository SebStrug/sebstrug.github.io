title: Identifying Chinese Calligraphy with Neural Nets
git: https://github.com/SebStrug/ML-for-Chinese-Calligraphy
---

Explored neural networks and their architectures to identify Chinese calligraphy,
such as convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transfer learning.

Built using TensorFlow & TensorBoard.
